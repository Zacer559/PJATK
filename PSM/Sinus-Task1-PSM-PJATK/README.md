# Sinus-Task1-PSM-PJATK

Program which is calculating value of sinus, for specified angle using Taylor series.

The program is very simple to use. You have to compile it and run. After that program is asking 3 questions.
- Provide an angle in degrees 
- Provide a number of iterations  (how many additions/subtractions will be made according to Taylor's theorem)
- Question about "masochism mode", if you answer "y" then the program will use BigDecimals to calculate sin(x). Then You are able to approximate sinus with thousands of decimal places, but of course, then is a problem, because the computer has to round the number. If you choose to answer "n" then the program calculates everything using doubles. 
After those questions program is showing sin(x) after each iteration and calculating the error between our value of sinus and Math.sin(angle in radius) function which is built into Java. Of course, when we are using BigDecimals this approximation of Math.sin() given by Java is ridiculously inaccurate :)
If You have any questions I can answer them via email

I hope this documentation is sufficient.
