    <h1>The Nissan GT-R is a high-performance sports car and grand tourer produced by Nissan that was unveiled in
        2007.</h1>
    <p>Between 1969 and 1974, and again between 1989 and 2002, Nissan produced a high performance version of its Skyline coupe called the Nissan Skyline GT-R. This car proved to be iconic for Nissan and achieved much fame and success on both road and track.</p>

    <p>The GT-R is an entirely new model sharing little with the Skyline GT-R save its signature four round tail lights. Like some later generations of the Skyline GT-R, the GT-R has all-wheel drive with a twin-turbocharged 6-cylinder engine. But the four-wheel-steering HICAS system has been removed and the former straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been replaced with a new VR38DETT V6 engine. Because of the GT-R's heritage, the chassis code for the all-new version has been called CBA-R35, or R35 for short (where CBA stands for the emissions standard prefix), carrying on the naming trend from previous Skyline GT-R generations.</p>

    <p>The GT-R has also retained its Skyline predecessor's nickname, Godzilla,[9] originally given to it by the Australian motoring publication Wheels in its July 1989 edition.</p>
    <p>Nissan showed two GT-R concept cars at motor shows before it unveiled the production model: one at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2001, to preview a 21st-century GT-R</p>
    <p>Officials said the production GT-R would be 80 to 90% based on the second concept.</p>
