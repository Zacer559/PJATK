    <p>The 458 is powered by a 4,497 cc (4.5 L; 274.4 cu in) engine of the "Ferrari/Maserati" F136 V8 family, generating
        a power output of 570 PS (419 kW; 562 hp) at 9,000 rpm (redline) and 540 N⋅m (398 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,000
        rpm with 80% torque available at 3,250 rpm. The engine features direct fuel injection, which is a first
        for Ferrari mid-engine setups in its road cars.

    <p>The only transmission available on the 458 is a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox by Getrag, in a different
        state of tune shared with the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG. There is no traditional manual option, making this the
        fourth road-car after the Enzo, Challenge Stradale and 430 Scuderia not to be offered with Ferrari's classic
        gated manual. It is the first mainstream model to not be offered with a manual transmission.</p>

    <p>In keeping with Ferrari tradition, the body was designed by Pininfarina under the leadership of Donato Coco, the
        Ferrari design director during 2009.</p>
    <p>The interior design of the Ferrari 458 Italia was done by Bertrand Rapatel (Director of Ferrari Interior Design),
        a French automobile designer.</p>
    <p>The car's exterior styling and features were designed for aerodynamic efficiency, producing downforce of 140 kg
        (309 lb) at 200 km/h (120 mph).</p>

    <h3>Handling</h3>
    <figure class="r right"><img src="ferrari_side.jpg">
        <figcaption> drifting Ferrari 458 Italia
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p> The car's suspension has double wishbones at the front and a multi-link setup at the rear, coupled with E-Diff
        and F1-Trac traction control systems, designed to improve the car's cornering and longitudinal acceleration by
        32% when compared with its predecessors.
    </p>
    <p>The brakes include a prefill function whereby the pistons in the calipers move the pads into contact with the
        discs on lift off to minimize delay in the brakes being applied.[10] This, combined with the ABS and standard
        Carbon Ceramic brakes, have caused a reduction in stopping distance from 100–0 km/h (62-0 mph) to 32.5 metres
        (107 ft). Tests have shown the car will stop from 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 90 feet (27 m) or in 85 feet (26 m)
        with run flat tires, 85 feet (26 m) from 60 mph (97 km/h) and 80 feet (24 m) from 60 mph (97 km/h) with run flat
        tires.
