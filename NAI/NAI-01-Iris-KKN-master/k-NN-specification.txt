k-NN classifier

Time to complete the project: 1 week.

The goal is to implement k-NN classifier. The program should take 3 arguments:
k: positive natural being the k-NN hiperparameter
train-set: iristrain.csv
test-set: iristest.csv

The program should apply k-NN classifier based on the train set to each vector from the test set and produce the accuracy.

The program should additionally provide a simple interface (not necessarily graphical) to make it possible to input single vectors by the user to be classified.

Optional extension: prepare a graph (excel, python, R, etc.) showing the accuracy vs the value of k

During presentation the program should be also tested on additional single vectors.

You cannot use any Machine Learning libraries, everything has to be implemented from scratch. The distances must be calculated by using arithmetic operations (you can use java.lang.Math).
