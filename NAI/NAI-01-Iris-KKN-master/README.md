# NAI-01-Iris-KKN
It is a simple program which is using Iris dataset, to learn and recognize different irises.
It is very simple to use, just compile and run:


First question "Would you like to use iristest dataset? (y/n) 
                 If no then you have to input your values for plant"
        If you answer yes then the program will recognize all flowers specified in iristest.csv file.
                    Then the program will ask next question : 
                    Would you like to check for which value of closest plants the result is most accurate?(y/n)
                            If you answer yes, then the program will check and print for which value of closest plants algorithm is most accurate.
                    Else next step            
        Then the program will ask "How many closest plants would You like to check?"
        After that program will print all plants, their types and that the recognition was correct or not and total accuracy.
        Program finish.
        
If you answer no then the program will ask next question  "Input data in format: double sepalLength double sepalWidth double petalLength double petalWidth "
After that program will print type of Iris which it recognized.
Program finish.
